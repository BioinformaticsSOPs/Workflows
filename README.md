# Workflows

This project is to simply allow the creation of documents to suggest/vet/finalize the "best" workflows for various bioinformatics analysis project types.  Documents should be descriptive:
Eg:
BacterialDNAVariantAnalysis

and contain sections for each proposed analysis.  Ideally, each Filename will be created as a separate git repository.
